# Demand-Spot
 Build a fully functional website for a platform called "DemandSpot" (you can replace this name with the final one). The platform connects aspiring entrepreneurs with low to medium investment (like $800–$1500 or ₹50,000–₹1,50,000) to hyperlocal business opportunities based on real-time local demand data collected from people in specific areas.

The platform has two main user types:

1. Business Starters – who enter their budget and get business ideas based on local demand.

2. Local Contributors – who submit what kind of businesses are missing in their area (like "No juice shop near the college").

Include the following features:

Home Page:

Catchy headline like “Turn Your Budget Into a Business”

Brief explanation of how the platform works

CTA buttons for "Find Business Ideas" and "Submit Local Demand"
